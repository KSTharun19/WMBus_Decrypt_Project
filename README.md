# WMBus_Decrypt_Project
This project decrypts W-MBus telegrams from water meters using AES-128. It converts the encrypted hex data to bytes, decrypts it using AES-128 CTR mode, and prints sample meter readings in JSON format. The program shows meter status, total consumption, and timestamp in human-readable form.
